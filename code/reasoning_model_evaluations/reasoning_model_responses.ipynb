    "## Does a reasoning model provide better solutions to the MacGyver problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "The MacGyver problems are a set of problems that are used to compare the ability to think out of the box to solve commonplace problems that are grounded in the physical world. Not all problems can be solved, and those that can be solved are not always solved by the LLM. This test and paper was done in March 2024 and the best model at that time (which also showed the best overall performance) was GPT-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the latest excitement and hype around reasoning models, we thought it would be interesting to see if a reasoning model can provide better solutions to the MacGyver problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook, we will be doing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in the Excel file with problem statements\n",
    "2. Send the problem statements to a reasoning model with the default prompt style used in the paper\n",
    "3. Get the responses from the reasoning model\n",
    "4. Potentially compare the responses with the ground truth solutions"
