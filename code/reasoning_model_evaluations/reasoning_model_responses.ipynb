    "## Does a reasoning model provide better solutions to the MacGyver problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "The MacGyver problems are a set of problems that are used to compare the ability to think out of the box to solve commonplace problems that are grounded in the physical world. Not all problems can be solved, and those that can be solved are not always solved by the LLM. This test and paper was done in March 2024 and the best model at that time (which also showed the best overall performance) was GPT-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the latest excitement and hype around reasoning models, we thought it would be interesting to see if a reasoning model can provide better solutions to the MacGyver problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook, we will be doing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in the Excel file with problem statements\n",
    "2. Send the problem statements to a reasoning model with the default prompt style used in the paper\n",
    "3. Get the responses from the reasoning model\n",
    "4. Potentially compare the responses with the ground truth solutions"

    "1. In many cases, the general approach provided by the human solution and all the LLMs are very similar - they tend to agree with each other. This is true for Problem ID 359: Cat on a high library shelf, Problem ID 669: Amplifying phone speaker by using cardboard box as reasonating chamber, Problem ID 443: crushing ice.\n",
    "2. In some cases, the tools used by the LLM are not used by the human solution. Problem 1366: creating a splint on a broke leg - all the LLMs tend to use the bottle as the splint whereas the human solution doesn't use the bottle at all. Surprisingly, GPT4o acts similar to human solution and does not consider the bottle. Problem 937: crushing pepper corns the human and all OpenAI solutions use the fork to crush the pepper corns. But the Deepseek solution asks to use the glass jar to gring the corns against the greater which seemed more feasible to me.\n",
    "3. There was also Problem ID 1155: chopping vegetables where gpt4o could not come up with a solution whereas the reasoning LLMs all came up with reasonable solutions similar to the human solution.\n",
    "4. Problem ID 480: sleeping bag zipper - this is where I thought the human solution was much better thought out and complete rather than any of the LLM solution. Clearly outperforms LLMs."
